                  <p> I love God! Genesis 6:5-8</p>
                  <p>5 When the LORD saw how wicked everyone on earth was and how evil their thoughts were all the time, 6 he was sorry that he had ever made them and put them on the earth. He was so filled with regret 7that he said, “I will wipe out these people I have created, and also the animals and the birds, because I am sorry that I made any of them.” 8 But the LORD was pleased with Noah.</p>

                  <p>Cook Chicken: Heat a large pan or wok on high heat then pour in 1 tablespoon oil. Season chicken with salt and pepper and add to hot pan. Sauté until cooked through then remove to a plate. Whisk sauce ingredients together and set aside.
                    Add Vegetables: Add another tablespoon of oil. Once hot, add cabbage, carrots, celery, and the whites of the chopped green onion. Stir fry over high heat for 1-2 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds, then remove everything to a plate.
                    Combine: Add last tablespoon of oil to the pan and add the noodles. Cook for 1 minute. Add the sauce and cook, tossing to coat then return veggies and chicken to the pan, along with fresh bean sprouts.
                    Serve immediately, garnished with green onion.</p>

                  <p> I love God! Luke 2:1-7</p>
                  <p>1 At that time the Emperor Augustus ordered a census to be taken throughout the Roman Empire. 2 When this first census took place, Quirinius was the governor of Syria. 3 Everyone, then, went to register himself, each to his own town. 4 Joseph went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to the town of Bethlehem in Judea, the birthplace of King David. Joseph went there because he was a descendant of David. 5 He went to register with Mary, who was promised in marriage to him. She was pregnant, 6 and while they were in Bethlehem, the time came for her to have her baby. 7 She gave birth to her first son, wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger — there was no room for them to stay in the inn.</p>

                  <p>Beat eggs well with a pinch of salt and sliced green onions. Set aside.
                    Heat a wok or a skillet over high heat; add 1 tbsp cooking oil and swirl to coat. Pour beaten eggs into the wok and scramble.
                    When the eggs are cooked 3/4 way, add the remaining 2 tbsp cooking oil and cold jasmine rice.
                    A day-old cold jasmine rice is my absolute favorite to make fried rice. It has a beautiful aroma and fluffy texture that can hold the shape well while frying.
                    Add soy sauce around the edge of the wok, so it will burn slightly for the smoky umami flavor. Add salt to your taste and mix everything well. Reduce heat to low if you need to.
                    Turn off the heat.</p>
